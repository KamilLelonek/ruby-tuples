# Tuples

Ruby implementation for tuples known from functional programming.

Tuple combines a fixed number of items together so that they can be passed around as a whole. Unlike an array or list, a tuple can hold objects with different types but they are also immutable.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tuples'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tuples

## Usage

...

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Tests

To run all tests from `test` directory execute `rake`, which has a default task that points to `rake test`.
